MERN Stack Stock &amp; Discount System - Interview Project
Instructions to run the project
Navigate to the backend folder and run npm i in the terminal to install dependencies.

Do the same for the frontend folder by running npm i to install React dependencies.

Start the servers:

In the backend folder, run npm start.

In the frontend folder, run npm run dev.

By default:

The backend server will run on PORT 5000.

The frontend server will run on PORT 5173.

I have used MongoDB Atlas as the database.

If you face any unexpected issues (e.g., database connection errors), please let me know. I’ll be happy to get on a quick call and share my screen to show the project.

I’ve already enabled access from anywhere in MongoDB Atlas, so you should be able to connect without issues.
